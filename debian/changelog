  * Merge pull request #36 <https://github.com/LCAS/realsense_gazebo_plugin/issues/36> from marcoesposito1988/patch-2
    Overridable camera_name arg of depth_proc.launch
  * Overridable camera_name arg of depth_proc.launch
    Doing so allows inclusion in external launch files using other cameras
  * Merge pull request #35 <https://github.com/LCAS/realsense_gazebo_plugin/issues/35> from marcoesposito1988/patch-1
    Catkin package.xml v2, add missing dependency
  * Catkin package.xml v2, add missing dependency
  * Fix depth processing
    Broken after #25 <https://github.com/LCAS/realsense_gazebo_plugin/issues/25> fix.
    Had to rename the topics properly for the
    depth processing node.
    Solves #32 <https://github.com/LCAS/realsense_gazebo_plugin/issues/32>
  * Enable multiple R200 to co-exist in one world
    This was previously broken because all R200 plugins would publish
    under the same topics and overwrite each other. This is now fixed
    and there is a demo launch file to show that it works :)
    Solves #25 <https://github.com/LCAS/realsense_gazebo_plugin/issues/25>
  * Remove fake origin -> color TF publisher
  * Compute focal from rendering's horizontal FOV
    Fixes #28 <https://github.com/LCAS/realsense_gazebo_plugin/issues/28>
  * Simplify camera & encoding identification
  * Add dependency to image_pipeline in package manifest
  * Add important note on supported ROS/Gazebo versions
    Addresses the recurrent issues reporting that the master branch
    fails to compile on ROS Kinetic + Gazebo 7.

    Add prefix to URDF to allow multiple cameras in the same scene
  * Update parent xacro to fit the new macro
    This also serves an example of how to use the other file..
  * Add prefix and parent to RS200 macro
    This allows the use of multiple cameras and is cleaner to insert.
